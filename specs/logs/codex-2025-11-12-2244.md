**Review Update**
- Logged the latest review in `specs/review.md:1`, pointing to commit `4a1fa14` and marking the port as “not ok” because of the remaining `/up` regression.
- Flagged the real issue at `revurb-ts/src/Servers/Reverb/factory.ts:976`: swapping in `new Response({ health: 'OK' }, { status: 200 })` still emits the literal text `[object Object]` with `Content-Type: text/plain`, so the `/up` endpoint does not return the documented JSON payload. It needs `Response.json({ health: 'OK' })` (or manual `JSON.stringify` plus an `application/json` header) before health probes can rely on it.
- Pushed the review report as commit `4a1fa14` on `main`. No automated tests were run because this task only required a code review.

Next steps:
1. Update `handleHealthCheck` to serialize JSON correctly and add the appropriate `Content-Type`.
2. Re-run any existing health-check probes or monitoring that depend on `/up` to confirm the fix once applied.
