status: ok
review comments:
- reverb/tests/Specification/spec-analyze.ts: Added structure dumps when the agent key is missing so failed Autobahn runs are diagnosable without rerunning.
- example/src/App.tsx: The landing copy now accurately explains how to use the Chat demo; no functional changes introduced.
- scripts/ralph/current.md: Objective 0 now cites the commit that implemented the chat example, so the tracker matches the codebase state.
