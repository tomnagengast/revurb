**Findings**
- `tests/e2e/websocket-connection.test.ts:96` now resolves the WebSocket payload as `unknown`, but the test still dereferences `message.event`/`message.data` at `tests/e2e/websocket-connection.test.ts:118`. Because there's no narrowing or type assertion, TypeScript immediately reports TS2339 the moment the test file is type-checked. Please describe the payload (e.g. via an interface) or assert its shape before touching those fields so the lint fix doesn’t introduce compile errors.

**Notes**
- Logged the review outcome for `1fddd18` in `specs/review.md:1` and captured the above blocker; committed and pushed as `a496e19`.
- Ran `bun run lint`, `bun run typecheck`, and `bun run test` to verify the state before filing the review.

Next step: 1) add a typed payload (or explicit cast) in the WebSocket E2E test so the promise resolves to a concrete structure instead of `unknown`.
