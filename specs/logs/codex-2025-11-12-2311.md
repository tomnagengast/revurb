**Review Update**
- Logged the latest review result in `specs/review.md:1`, capturing `last commit: c16f44d` with `status: ok`, since the new work is purely documentation and introduces no regressions.
- Audited `revurb-ts/agent/SESSION_2025-01-27_CONTINUATION.md:1`; it’s an informational status recap that aligns with the current repo state and doesn’t require corrective work.
- Confirmed the Bun test suite is still healthy by running `bun test` inside `revurb-ts`, which completed without failures, matching the session note’s “tests passing” claim.
- Committed the review update as `docs: record review for continuation session` and pushed to `origin/main`.
