**Review Update**
- `specs/review.md:1` now captures HEAD `84ad5ce`, marks the build “not ok,” and documents the two blocking issues uncovered after checking `gh run list`/`gh run view`.
- `tests/feature/health-check-controller.test.ts:2` (and the other spec/e2e suites updated with it) import `../../src/servers/reverb/factory`, but git still tracks the implementation at `src/Servers/Reverb/factory.ts`. On the case-sensitive GitHub runners the `tests.yml` job (`gh run view 19337509865`) dies with “Cannot find module '../../src/servers/reverb/factory'…”, so the directory rename needs to be completed with `git mv` or the imports must revert to the capitalized path.
- `tests/unit/managers/array-channel-manager.test.ts:6` and `src/jobs/ping-inactive-connections.ts:4` import `src/protocols/pusher/...` even though the repository still stores `src/Protocols/Pusher/...`; `static-analysis.yml` (`gh run view 19337509860`) reports TS2307 for every reference. Please finish renaming those directories (e.g., `git mv src/Protocols src/protocols`, `git mv src/Protocols/Pusher src/protocols/pusher`) or restore the original casing before proceeding.

Next steps:
1. Align the filesystem casing with the imports (Servers → servers, Protocols → protocols, etc.) so Linux runners can resolve the modules.
2. Re-run the failing workflows (`gh run rerun 19337509865`, `gh run rerun 19337509860`) to confirm CI is green.

Committed and pushed as `75859a5`.
