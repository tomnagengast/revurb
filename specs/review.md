review comments:
- `revurb-ts/agent/CURRENT_SESSION_STATUS.md:3-44` and `revurb-ts/agent/SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-01-27.md:3-53` present the port as "complete" even though running `./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit` currently fails: the HTTP controllers read `request.path`, `request.body`, and `request.method` even though `IHttpRequest` does not expose those properties (`revurb-ts/src/Protocols/Pusher/Http/Controllers/controller.ts:78-92`, `revurb-ts/src/Protocols/Pusher/Http/Controllers/channels-controller.ts:111-118,211-212`), the metrics handler casts `ConnectionData` into a `Map` (`revurb-ts/src/Protocols/Pusher/metrics-handler.ts:262` and `:583`), and the anonymous `ServerProvider` subclass in the factory overrides `subscribesToEvents()` without the required `override` modifier (`revurb-ts/src/Servers/Reverb/factory.ts:242-248`). The docs need to match reality, and these type errors must be fixed before calling the port production-ready.
- `revurb-ts/agent/SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-01-27.md:33-36` claims "Proper TypeScript types (no \`any\` types)" but the code still exposes `any`, for example `options?: Record<string, any>` and `find(key: string, value: any)` in `revurb-ts/src/config-application-provider.ts:17-93`. Either remove the `any` usage per workspace rules or adjust the summary; right now the statement is incorrect.
- `revurb-ts/agent/SESSION_2025-01-27_MAINTENANCE.md:5-53` says this session populated `revurb-ts/docker-compose.yml` and created `revurb-ts/Dockerfile`, yet there are no commits in `c16f44d..370ee45` touching those files (`git log --oneline c16f44d..HEAD -- revurb-ts/docker-compose.yml` is empty). Session notes need to describe the actual code changes under review so the audit trail is meaningful.
