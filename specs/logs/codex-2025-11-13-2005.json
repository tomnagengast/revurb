{"commit":"ae676bdf6ad0ffd9e266c92288076fdbe2973058","status":"ok","review_comments":["README.md:139-146 and .github/workflows/spec-tests.yml:34-41 – No blocking issues: both docs and CI now mount `tests/spec/reports` at `/mnt/autobahn/reports`, matching `tests/spec/client-spec.json:3` and the analyzer’s expectations (`tests/spec/spec-analyze.ts:6-7`), and the README command documents `--platform linux/amd64` so Apple Silicon contributors can run Autobahn locally.","Residual risk – Both the README recipe and CI workflow still rely on `--network host` (`README.md:141`, `.github/workflows/spec-tests.yml:37`), which Docker Desktop for macOS doesn’t support, so Autobahn remains effectively Linux-only until an alternative networking strategy is documented."],"additional_comments":"Logged the review in specs/logs/codex-2025-11-13-2009.json, updated specs/review.md, committed (ae676bd) and pushed. Hooks ran `biome check --write .` and `tsc --noEmit`. Pre-existing changes in tests/spec/client-spec.json and specs/2025-11-13-2008-production-ready-redis.md remain uncommitted per your tree."}
