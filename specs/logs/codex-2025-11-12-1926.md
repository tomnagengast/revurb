**Review Summary**
- `revurb-ts/src/Servers/Reverb/Http/request.ts:8` now re-exports `IHttpRequest`, so the controllers that import the type from this module regain their typings and the port no longer blocks on “Module has no exported member 'IHttpRequest'”.
- `specs/review.md` now captures the latest commit `873777f29ad7130b6c356b5abc8e03210f999282` with `status: ok`, overwriting the prior review as required.

**Verification**
- `bun run typecheck` (in `revurb-ts`) failed because `node_modules/typescript/lib/tsc.js` is missing, so I couldn’t confirm the fix via TypeScript; the repo likely needs dependencies installed before this script can succeed.

**Next Steps**
1. Reinstall dependencies (e.g., `bun install`) and rerun `bun run typecheck` to double-check there are no remaining typing issues once TypeScript is available.
