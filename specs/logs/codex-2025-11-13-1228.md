**Summary**
- Reviewed and kept the `scripts/ralph/sync.sh` helper in sync by enforcing `command` invocations, ensuring the log directories exist up front, hardening the `git pull` workflow with stashing for dirty trees, and fixing the final Discord hook quoting (`scripts/ralph/sync.sh:7-42`). No functional issues were found during review.
- Recorded that commit `95ef9e1` has no outstanding problems by overwriting `specs/review.md` with the required status block (`specs/review.md:1-2`).
- Captured the review session details for traceability in `specs/logs/codex-2025-11-13-1213.md` and the associated composer run in `specs/logs/composer-2025-11-13-1228.md`.

**Tests**
- `bun run lint`
- `biome check --write .` (pre-commit hook)
- `tsc --noEmit`
