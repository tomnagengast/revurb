**Code Review**
- Verified the presence roster now iterates actual `ChannelConnection`s by materializing the underlying `Map` in both implementations, restoring correct member lists and `userIsSubscribed` checks (`revurb-ts/src/Protocols/Pusher/Channels/presence-channel.ts:166`, `revurb-ts/src/Protocols/Pusher/Channels/presence-cache-channel.ts:173`).
- Confirmed the metrics handler now treats `ChannelManager.all()`/`Channel.connections()` as record structures before filtering or counting, and reads presence metadata out of the stored `Map`, which fixes the `/channels`, `/channel`, and `/channel/users` APIs that previously crashed or returned empty data (`revurb-ts/src/Protocols/Pusher/metrics-handler.ts:224`, `revurb-ts/src/Protocols/Pusher/metrics-handler.ts:255`, `revurb-ts/src/Protocols/Pusher/metrics-handler.ts:520`, `revurb-ts/src/Protocols/Pusher/metrics-handler.ts:579`).
- Checked the `PingInactiveConnections` job unwraps each `ChannelConnection` before calling `isActive()` and pinging, eliminating the runtime `isActive is not a function` failure and ensuring stale sockets actually get pinged (`revurb-ts/src/jobs/ping-inactive-connections.ts:63`).
- Recorded the review outcome (no blocking issues) per the required template (`specs/review.md:1`).

Next step (optional): add targeted tests around the metrics handler and presence roster endpoints so future Map/Record mismatches are caught automatically.
