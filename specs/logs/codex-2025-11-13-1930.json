{"commit":"3c40dc306623208ab37427342c6b8fab726019ab","status":"not ok","review_comments":[".github/workflows/spec-tests.yml:31 – The workflow still shells into `reverb/tests/...`, but `reverb/` is gitignored, so Actions runners will not get any of those Bun scripts/configs and the job will fail immediately. The task was to rely on revurb-ts itself; move or vendor the Autobahn harness into tracked sources and drop the dependency on the external reference checkout.","example/src/Chat.tsx:12 – Replacing `location.host` with `window.location.hostname` plus manual `:${port}` breaks IPv6 defaults (e.g., produces `wss://2001:db8::1:443` without brackets). Either revert to `location.host` or wrap IPv6 hosts in `[]` before adding the port so non-IPv4 deployments keep working."],"additional_comments":"README.md/docs.md still describe the PHP project; once the spec workflow is hooked into the TypeScript sources, those docs still need a pass. Tests: biome check --write ., tsc --noEmit."}
