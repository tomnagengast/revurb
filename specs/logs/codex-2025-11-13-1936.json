    ".github/workflows/spec-tests.yml:31 – The workflow still runs Bun/Docker commands out of ./reverb/tests/... even though reverb/ is gitignored in this repo, so Actions checkouts will not have those scripts or configs and the job will fail immediately when it tries to start the spec server. Please move the Autobahn harness into revurb-ts proper (as requested) or vendor what you need into tracked sources so CI isn’t depending on an external reference folder.",
    "example/src/Chat.tsx:12 – Replacing location.host with window.location.hostname drops the IPv6 bracket handling and the manual :${port} concatenation now yields invalid sockets like wss://2001:db8::1:443. Revert to location.host (which already includes both brackets and port) or detect IPv6 hosts and wrap them in [] before appending the port so non-IPv4 deployments keep working."

  "additional_comments": "README.md and docs.md still describe the PHP project; give them a pass once the spec workflow is wired up to the TypeScript sources."
