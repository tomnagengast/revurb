- Minimize the amount of "safety" code. This is a demo and anything other than showing how to work with revurb should be considered a distraction
- Should build on the great devex seen in `~/personal/_clones/laravel/echo` with additional inspiration from `~/personal/_clones/stephenjason89/bun-pulse` where it aligns with Laravel Echo
