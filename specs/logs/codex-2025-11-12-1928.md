**Code Review**
- Reviewed diff 873777f→45f7f72; only change in `revurb-ts/src/Servers/Reverb/Http/request.ts` refactors the `IHttpRequest` re-export without altering runtime behavior, so nothing critical to flag.
- Updated `specs/review.md:1` with the latest commit hash and status `ok` per the requested format.

No further action needed right now.
