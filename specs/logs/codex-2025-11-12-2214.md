**Review Outcome**  
- Verified that `RedisClientFactory` now exposes `createClient` as `protected` and clearly documents the default no‑op mock plus override guidance, so integrators can supply a real Redis client without forking (revurb-ts/src/Servers/Reverb/Publishing/redis-client-factory.ts:70-218).  
- Documentation updates now mark Redis Pub/Sub as mock/non-production-ready and scope “production ready” claims to single-server deployments (revurb-ts/README.md:9-18,164-168; revurb-ts/agent/SESSION_STATUS_2025-01-27.md:3-52). No additional issues surfaced in the reviewed commits, so the port work since commit 5f6f9d8 is acceptable.

**Files Updated**  
- Overwrote `specs/review.md:1-2` with the latest report (`last commit: 6f7b6d3…` / `status: ok`).

Committed as `bf23a1a` and pushed to `origin/main`.

Next step suggestion: 1) Update `revurb-ts/agent/SESSION_STATUS_2025-01-27.md` so its “Review status” entry matches the new `status: ok`.
