# Review Fixes - 2025-11-13-1335

## Status: 🔄 In Progress - Fixes Applied, Awaiting CI Verification

### Issues Addressed

#### 1. Duplicate Loggers Directory (Case-Sensitivity Issue) ✅ Fixed
- **Problem**: Logger modules existed in both `src/loggers/*` and `src/Loggers/*`, causing TS1149 errors on case-sensitive filesystems (Linux CI runners)
- **Root Cause**: Git was tracking both directories due to case-insensitive macOS filesystem
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Removed duplicate `src/Loggers/` directory from Git tracking
  - Kept lowercase `src/loggers/` directory (matches import paths)
  - Verified TypeScript compilation passes locally
- **Commit**: `9173220` - "fix: remove duplicate Loggers directory (case-sensitivity issue)"

#### 2. WebSocket Test Port Conflict ✅ Fixed
- **Problem**: Test hard-coded port 8084, causing `EADDRINUSE` errors on GitHub runners
- **Root Cause**: Port 8084 may be in use by other processes on CI runners
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Changed test to use ephemeral port (port 0)
  - Get actual assigned port from `server.port` after server starts
  - Updated test to use dynamic port for WebSocket connection
- **Commit**: Pending - "fix: use ephemeral port in WebSocket test to avoid EADDRINUSE"

#### 3. Documentation Accuracy ⚠️ Needs Update
- **Problem**: Previous docs claimed objectives complete despite CI failures
- **Status**: This document created to track actual status
- **Action Required**: Update previous docs after CI verification

### Verification Status

- ✅ TypeScript compilation (`tsc --noEmit`) - Passes locally
- ✅ Lint (`bun run lint`) - Passes locally  
- ✅ Format (`bun run format`) - Passes locally
- ⏳ GitHub Actions workflows - Awaiting CI run results

### Next Steps

1. Push commits to trigger GitHub Actions workflows
2. Monitor workflow runs:
   - static-analysis.yml (should pass with duplicate directory removed)
   - tests.yml (should pass with ephemeral port)
   - spec-tests.yml (needs verification)
3. Update documentation once CI confirms green status
4. Address any remaining spec-tests failures if they occur

### Notes

- The fixes address the specific issues mentioned in the review
- Local verification passes, but CI environment may reveal additional issues
- Spec-tests workflow failure mentioned in review needs investigation after these fixes
