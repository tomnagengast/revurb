I was about to stage the review update when I noticed new working-tree changes I didn’t make—`scripts/ralph/README.md`, `scripts/ralph/prompt-fast.md`, `scripts/ralph/prompt-smart.md`, plus the untracked files `notes/2025-11-13-1023-review-fix-and-objectives.md` and `specs/logs/composer-2025-11-13-1021.md`. These weren’t present when I started. Do you want me to include them in the “commit all” step along with `specs/review.md`, or leave them as-is?
