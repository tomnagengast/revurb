1. Ensure GitHub Actions run successfully (should reflect @reverb/.github/workflows where relevant)
2. Update the example app so that is displays a chat example. The style and structure should stay a close to the current design as possible.
3. Ensure the `README.md` and `docs.md` reflect the current state of the project and align with the `reverb/README.md` and `docs/docs.md` respectively
