**Review Update**
- Saved the requested report to `specs/review.md` (last commit 5c5deaf82ec22d76f0b8236cf353bd6853accbf7) with status `not ok`.
- Flagged blocking regressions: HTTP responses always return 200/text because `Factory.convertToResponse` ignores the custom response’s status/headers; `/users/{userId}/terminate_connections` crashes because the injected `serverProvider` stub lacks `subscribesToEvents()`; `ChannelConnection` no longer proxies methods, so `PruneStaleConnections` blows up on `isStale()`; and `UsersTerminateController` constructs responses with the wrong argument order, producing malformed payloads.

**Next Steps**
1. Fix `convertToResponse` to read `statusCode`, body, and headers from `Servers/Reverb/Http/response` so auth/validation errors surface with the right codes and MIME type.
2. Provide a real `ServerProvider` (or guard null) so the terminate endpoint can decide between pub/sub and local disconnects without runtime errors, and correct the `Response` constructor usage there.
3. Restore the PHP-style proxy behavior on `ChannelConnection` (or unwrap before use) so jobs can call `isStale()/disconnect()/id()` and stale sockets actually get pruned.
