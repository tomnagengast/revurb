- Logged the latest review at `specs/review.md:1`, noting that trimming the query string out of `Factory.convertToHttpRequest().getPath()` means both `connections-controller` and `channel-users-controller` now parse their query params from a path that no longer contains `auth_key` / `auth_signature`, so those endpoints always throw “Authentication signature invalid.” even for valid requests. They need a query-bearing path (e.g., `request.path` or a preserved `url`) for parsing while still hashing the query-less path.  
- Committed and pushed as `cf28fb2 (chore: update review)`.

Next steps:
1. Feed the controllers a URL/path that still has the search portion (or have `convertToHttpRequest` expose one) so query parsing works again, keeping signature verification on the query-free path.
2. Add regression tests for `/apps/{id}/connections` and `/apps/{id}/channels/{channel}/users` to ensure signed requests continue to succeed.
