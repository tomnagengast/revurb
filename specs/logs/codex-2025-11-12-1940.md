- Verified the latest changes (presence channels, metrics handler, ping job) resolve the previously logged blockers and match the Laravel Reverb behavior; no new issues surfaced in commit `db52d0f89fee4a037a4eb54e5f2788ee7c15c9d1`.
- Overwrote `specs/review.md` with the required format to capture this review outcome (`status: ok`).
