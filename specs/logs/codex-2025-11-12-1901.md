**Review Logged**
- Recorded the latest review in `specs/review.md` for commit `a37c1b2d7c977132e51bd2f1ebff850fbaef1d93`, marking the status as not ok.
- Flagged a regression where `revurb-ts/src/Servers/Reverb/factory.ts:1090` now forwards headers directly from `HttpResponse`, but `revurb-ts/src/Servers/Reverb/Http/response.ts:40` does not set a default `Content-Type` and controllers such as `revurb-ts/src/Protocols/Pusher/Http/Controllers/channels-controller.ts:83` also omit it, so every JSON endpoint currently responds without `Content-Type: application/json`, violating the Pusher API contract.

**Next Steps**
- 1) Add a default `Content-Type: application/json` in `HttpResponse` or in `convertToResponse` when none is provided, then re-check the HTTP endpoints.
