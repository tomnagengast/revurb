{"commit":"d31bd9b02bca3fdfa0093fb5c094b2e923defd14","status":"not ok","review_comments":["example/src/Chat.tsx:11 – getDefaultServer() now uses location.host, so when the UI runs on Bun's dev server the default WebSocket URL becomes ws://localhost:3000 even though Revurb still binds to 8080 (example/reverb.config.ts:5). The chat demo now always errors on connect until the user manually edits the field. Please keep the default pointed at the Revurb server and treat the textbox as an override.",".github/workflows/spec-tests.yml:37 – The job still runs everything from reverb/tests/Specification, but commit 6b5754c deleted that tree and .gitignore:12 now excludes it. A clean checkout (and CI) no longer has that directory, so the workflow fails before running Autobahn. Either restore the reference repo, clone it dynamically, or migrate the workflow to the TypeScript spec harness.","LICENSE.md / package.json:13 – Removing the only license file without adding a replacement leaves the project effectively unlicensed even though package.json still advertises \"MIT\" and lists LICENSE.md in its published files. Until a new license is committed nobody can legally use or redistribute this code."],"additional_comments":"Blocking issues above need to be addressed before we can call this slice complete."}
