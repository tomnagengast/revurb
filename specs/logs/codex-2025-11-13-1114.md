**Review Update**
- Captured the latest review in `specs/review.md:1` (status not ok) highlighting failures blocking the Laravel Reverb → revurb-ts port; pushed as commit `15af91d`.
- Confirmed Objective 0 from `scripts/ralph/current.md:1` is still open: `bun run lint` reports 109 errors, starting with non-null/any violations in `src/protocols/pusher/metrics-handler.ts:28` and `src/protocols/pusher/http/controllers/events-batch-controller.ts:104`.
- Objective 1 from `scripts/ralph/current.md:2` also remains untouched—no changes under `.github/workflows`, so CI parity work has not begun.

- Tests: `bun run lint` (fails – 109 errors), `bun run typecheck`.

Next steps:
1. Drive `bun run lint` to green by removing the remaining `any` usage and non-null assertions called out in `specs/review.md`.
2. Start porting the GitHub Actions definitions from `@reverb/.github` so Objective 1 can be closed.
