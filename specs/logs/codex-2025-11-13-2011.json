{"commit":"655f9ee770aa14f21a787901e0d5546ce7dbad0a","status":"not ok","review_comments":["src/servers/reverb/publishing/redis-client.ts:295 and src/servers/reverb/publishing/redis-client-factory.ts:111 – `redisUrl()` encodes username, password, and selected database as query parameters (`?username=…&password=…&db=…`), but `RedisClientFactory.make()` only ever inspects URL username/password fields and the pathname for `db`. When the user configures Redis via the provided env vars (`REDIS_USERNAME`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`, `REDIS_DB`), those values are silently ignored and the client always connects anonymously to database 0. This makes the “production-ready” claim inaccurate because any password-protected/DB-selecting deployment fails to authenticate.","src/servers/reverb/publishing/redis-pubsub-provider.ts:106 – `subscribe()` registers a new `message` listener every time it runs, and the new `RedisSubscribeClient` autoreconnect logic (`src/servers/reverb/publishing/redis-subscribe-client.ts:32-55`) now invokes that method after each reconnect. Every disconnect/resubscribe leaks an additional handler, so each broadcast will be processed multiple times and memory usage will grow unbounded. You need to ensure the handler is registered once or de-registered before re-adding it."],"additional_comments":"Logged the review in notes/2025-11-13-2023-review.md:1 and pushed as 655f9ee.
