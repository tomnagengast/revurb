**Review Update**
- Recorded that no revurb-ts code changed between a37c1b2 and current HEAD 36ed7e6; only automation/log commits landed, so there were no new port issues to flag.
- Overwrote `specs/review.md` with the latest commit hash and `status: ok` per the required template.

No tests were run because no revurb-ts code changed. Let me know if you’d like a deeper dig into the non-revurb files touched in 36ed7e6 or if you expect additional validation.
