**Review Update**
- Refreshed `specs/review.md:1` with HEAD `5f6f9d8cfe7e323e07f80afeaa885d5f737f2700`, recorded status `not ok`, and documented two blocking findings around Redis client extensibility and the inaccurate “production ready” claim for the mock pub/sub implementation.
- Flagged that `revurb-ts/src/Servers/Reverb/Publishing/redis-client-factory.ts` still returns a no-op client yet the new session status file asserts Redis-backed broadcasting works, creating a disconnect the team must resolve before treating the port as complete. Changes committed as `a321a5a`.

**Next Steps**
1. Expose a real hook for supplying a concrete Redis client (e.g., make `createClient` protected or accept a factory dependency).
2. Implement or integrate an actual Redis client so publish/subscribe and event hooks work, and adjust the status documentation once that’s done.
