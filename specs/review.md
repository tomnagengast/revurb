status: not ok
review comments:
- `bun run typecheck` regressed: the new `channel-users-controller` typings still call `request.url`, `request.text()` and reuse that path in `verifySignature`, but `IHttpRequest` does not expose those members, so `tsc --noEmit` now fails (`src/protocols/pusher/http/controllers/channel-users-controller.ts:100,109,194-195`). `channels-controller` has the same issue by spreading an `unknown` into `{...info}` (`src/protocols/pusher/http/controllers/channels-controller.ts:107`), so we still cannot produce a green type-check.
- Objective 0 is still wide open. `bun run lint` reports 117 errors, with the new commits leaving the earlier violations untouched: non-null assertions at `src/protocols/pusher/http/controllers/events-controller.ts:121-123` and `src/protocols/pusher/managers/array-channel-manager.ts:221`, `Record<string, any>` at `src/protocols/pusher/http/controllers/channels-controller.ts:268`, lingering `any` parameters throughout `src/protocols/pusher/http/controllers/connections-controller.ts:36-75`, and `payload: any` in `src/protocols/pusher/pubsub-incoming-message-handler.ts:14`, so Objective 0 from `scripts/ralph/current.md` remains unmet.
- Objective 1 ("Ensure GitHub Actions run successfully") is still untouched: there are no changes under `.github/workflows` in commits `2e54f30..42bd78b`, and `scripts/ralph/current.md:1-2` continues to track that as active work, so CI still doesn't match `@reverb/.github`.
