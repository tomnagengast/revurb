**Review Update**
- `specs/review.md:1` now records the latest reviewed commit (`74858c8`) with `status: ok`, reflecting that the recent documentation-only updates (workflow review notes and supporting logs) introduce no porting regressions.
- Added trace logs for this review cycle in `specs/logs/codex-2025-11-13-0734.md:1` and `specs/logs/composer-2025-11-13-0740.md:1` so the rationale and command history stay auditable.

Tests were not run because the changes are documentation/log updates only. Next: resume porting Laravel Reverb features toward revurb-ts parity.
