Documented the latest findings in `specs/review.md:1` and pushed `cb85b40`.

Issue found:
- `src/certificate.ts:29` now hard-codes `Certificate.resolve/paths/herdPath/valetPath` inside every static helper, so subclass overrides are ignored. The PHP source relies on late static binding (`static::`) to let consumers customize certificate directories; this TypeScript change regresses that behavior and blocks advanced setups that extend `Certificate`.

Next steps:
1. Restore late-binding by switching those static calls back to `this.resolve()`, `this.paths()`, etc., mirroring Laravel Reverb so subclasses keep working.
