    "README.md:89 now says `REVERB_SERVER_HOST` defaults to `127.0.0.1`, but the implementation still binds to `0.0.0.0` in src/config/load.ts:158. The documentation suggests the server only listens on localhost even though it actually exposes all interfaces, which is a security-sensitive mismatch. Please align the default or fix the docs so users know the true behavior."

  "additional_comments": "Documented the review outcome in specs/review.md:1 and committed the Codex log artifacts (specs/logs/codex-2025-11-13-1500.json, specs/logs/codex-2025-11-13-1512-doc-validation.json) so the automation history stays intact. Changes are pushed (review: capture findings for 921afed). Next step: correct the README or change the default bind host so the stated behavior matches the code."
