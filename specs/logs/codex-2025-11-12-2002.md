- Recorded the latest review against `196ada14317180c7f595d9e27f17cc801edfca7c` in `specs/review.md:1`, flagging the outstanding items.

**Findings**
- `revurb-ts/src/loggers/log.ts:34` / `revurb-ts/src/Servers/Reverb/factory.ts:215` – The new `Log` facade never binds to the real logger, so it always falls back to `NullLogger`. Any ported code that calls `Log.info(...)` will silently drop output until the facade resolves the factory’s logger.
- `src/Loggers/log.ts:1` – A duplicate TypeScript copy of the facade was added under the original PHP source tree, importing PHP-only modules. It can’t compile and diverges from `Log.php`; it should live only under `revurb-ts/src/loggers`.

**Next steps**
1. Wire the facade into the bootstrap path (e.g., keep `Log.getLogger()` in sync with `Factory` or call `Log.setLogger(...)` during initialization).
2. Remove or relocate the stray `.ts` file from `src/Loggers` so the PHP tree stays PHP-only.

No tests were run (review-only change).
