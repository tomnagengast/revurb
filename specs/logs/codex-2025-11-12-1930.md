Wrote the requested review in `specs/review.md`, flagging (1) the broken `PingInactiveConnections` job, (2) presence channels misreading their connection map (so member tracking is wrong), and (3) the metrics handler assuming arrays when the channel APIs return plain objects, which makes the HTTP metrics endpoints unusable.
