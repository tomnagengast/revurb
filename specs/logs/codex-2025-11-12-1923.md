**Code Review**
- `revurb-ts/src/Servers/Reverb/Http/request.ts:8` still does not re-export `IHttpRequest`, so every controller that imports the type from this module (`revurb-ts/src/Protocols/Pusher/Http/Controllers/controller.ts:5`, `channels-controller.ts:2`, `pusher-controller.ts:5`) continues to throw “Module has no exported member 'IHttpRequest'”; the port can’t compile until the interface is re-exported or the imports target `router.ts` instead.

Updates
- Wrote the latest review (hash c58aaefec716d6ba0c1cf838c35e30521cbb532d, status not ok) to `specs/review.md`.

Next steps
1. Re-export `IHttpRequest` from `revurb-ts/src/Servers/Reverb/Http/request.ts` (or update consumers) so the controllers regain their typings and the TypeScript build succeeds.
