{"commit":"dc52b77ba7182729b2177c89a4aefbefd55540ed","status":"ok","review_comments":["example/src/App.tsx:24 – Copy now walks users through entering a name, connecting, joining a channel, and opening multiple tabs, which matches the existing Chat component behavior so no regressions are introduced.","reverb/tests/Specification/spec-analyze.ts:19 – When the Autobahn index lacks an agent key we now log the discovered keys and a truncated payload, making failures diagnosable without altering the exit behavior.","scripts/ralph/current.md:1 – The in-flight objective is marked complete with a reference to commit e9f97a8, so the tracker accurately reflects the chat example work."],"additional_comments":"No automated coverage exercises the example UI or the new spec-analyze logging path, so future changes to either area will still rely on manual verification."}
