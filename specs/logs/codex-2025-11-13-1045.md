Updated `specs/review.md` with today’s findings (HEAD 29fba8a) and pushed the signed commit (`730db64`). The `git add -A` you asked for also scooped up the pending `biome.json` tweak (adds `globals: ["Bun"]`), so that change is now recorded alongside the review.

**Findings**
- `bun run lint` still exits non‑zero. Biome reports blocking errors such as `lint/complexity/noStaticOnlyClass` in `src/protocols/pusher/channels/channel-broker.ts:37` and `lint/suspicious/noExplicitAny` in `src/protocols/pusher/concerns/interacts-with-channel-information.ts:10`, so objective #0 (“Fix the lint errors returned by bun run lint”) remains unmet.
- `bun run typecheck` fails with multiple TypeScript errors: assigning `app.options` directly to `config.options` violates the declared type in `src/application-manager.ts:132`; the CLI logger still treats parsed message payloads as `unknown` when reading `channel_data` (`src/Loggers/cli-logger.ts:109-114`); `src/protocols/pusher/channels/presence-cache-channel.ts:220` indexes `hash` with a key typed as `unknown`; `src/protocols/pusher/http/controllers/channels-controller.ts:229-233` passes a possibly undefined secret into `hmacSha256`; and `src/servers/reverb/connection.ts:199-228` references `onMessageHandler`, `_onCloseHandler`, and `maxMessageSize` without declaring them. The build can’t proceed until these are corrected.

**Commands**
- `bun run lint`
- `bun run typecheck`
- `git push origin main`

**Next steps**
1. Finish cleaning up the Biome errors (convert static-only helper classes to functions and replace the remaining `any` usages with concrete types).
2. Address the TypeScript compile failures noted above so `bun run typecheck` and the production build can succeed.

Let me know once those are addressed and I’ll run another review.
