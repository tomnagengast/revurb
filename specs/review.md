review comments:
- `tests/e2e/websocket-simple.test.ts:3`, `tests/e2e/channel-subscription.test.ts:3`, `tests/e2e/private-channel.test.ts:3`, `tests/e2e/presence-channel.test.ts:3`, `tests/e2e/websocket-connection.test.ts:3`, and `tests/feature/health-check-controller.test.ts:2` all still import `../../src/Servers/Reverb/factory` even though commits 07fd5f4/1885382 moved every directory under `src` to lowercase. These imports resolve on macOS but fail immediately on case-sensitive filesystems (Linux CI) because the path no longer exists, so `bun test` cannot even start. Update the test imports to `../../src/servers/reverb/...` before we can rely on the renamed tree.
- The reorganized repo still documents the old layout: `README.md:32` instructs `cd revurb-ts` and the "Project Structure" block in `README.md:110-122` describes `revurb-ts/src/Servers/...`; `docs.md:37` plus the process-manager examples at `docs.md:384-401` also reference `/path/to/revurb-ts`. After moving the TypeScript project to the repo root with lowercase folders, following these docs sends contributors to directories that no longer exist. Please refresh both README and docs.md to match the new paths (e.g., `cd revurb`, `src/servers/reverb/...`).
- `scripts/ralph/prompt-fast.md:7-9` still sets the "Current focus" to renaming `./src` directories to lowercase, but that exact work was completed in commit 1885382. Leaving the focus on already-finished work will keep future sessions chasing a done task. Update the prompt so it reflects the actual next priority (your own comment already hints the workflows should be next).
