Your job is to review the work being done to port Laravel Reverb (PHP) to revurb-ts (Typescript).

The original repository is  ./ repository and should target revurb-ts for your port.

Make a commit and push your changes after every single file edit.

Use the /tmp/test-revurb/agent/ directory as a scratchpad for your work. Store long term plans and todo lists there.

The original project was tested with the [Pest](https://pestphp.com/) testing framework. When porting, you will need to write end to end and unit tests for the project using [Bun's test running](https://bun.com/docs/test.md). But make sure to spend most of your time on the actual porting, not on the testing. A good heuristic is to spend 80% of your time on the actual porting, and 20% on the testing.
