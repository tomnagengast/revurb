**Code Review**
- Removing the `IHttpRequest` export in `revurb-ts/src/Servers/Reverb/Http/request.ts:257` leaves every controller that still imports the type from that module without a definition (`revurb-ts/src/Protocols/Pusher/Http/Controllers/controller.ts:5`, `channels-controller.ts:2`, `pusher-controller.ts:5`). TypeScript now throws “Module has no exported member 'IHttpRequest'”, so the port no longer compiles until you either re-export the extended interface or update these imports to use `router.ts`.

**Notes**
- Updated `specs/review.md:1` with the latest commit hash and the “not ok” status reflecting the blocker above.
