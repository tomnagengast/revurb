Updated `specs/review.md` with the latest commit hash (2724186dc1f2d7c40ec11c72db4d80bf8b8575e1), marked the review as not ok, and documented the blocking issue.

Key finding:
- `revurb-ts/src/cli.ts:221-254` now registers event listeners that call `logger.debug(...)`, but `Factory.getLogger()` only ever returns `CliLogger` or `NullLogger`, neither of which (nor the `ILogger` contract) defines a `debug` method. Running the server with `--debug` will crash on the first channel/message event because `logger.debug` is undefined. Please either log via the existing `info`/`message` APIs or add a `debug` method to the logger contract and implementations.

No tests were run (review-only change).
