Your job is to review the work being done to port Laravel Reverb (PHP) to revurb-ts (Typescript).

The Laravel Reverb project is located in `./reverb` and you should target `./` for your port.

Revew the work done since your last review using the following format and save it to `./specs/review.md`:
```md
last commit: <commit-hash>
{if there is outstanding work that must be addressed}
status: not ok
review comments:
- <review comments>
{else if no serious issues}
status: ok
{endif}
```

This file should be overwritten with each code review.

Once you're finished with your review, commit all (git add -A && git commit -s <message>) and push.
