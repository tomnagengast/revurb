{"commit":"d31bd9b02bca3fdfa0093fb5c094b2e923defd14","status":"not ok","review_comments":["LICENSE.md / package.json:13 – The repository’s only license file was deleted in d31bd9b, yet package.json still advertises an MIT license and lists LICENSE.md in the published files. Until a new license is committed the project is effectively unlicensed, and npm publishes will fail looking for the missing file."," .github/workflows/spec-tests.yml:37 – This workflow still runs every step from reverb/tests/Specification, but commit 6b5754c removed that tree and .gitignore:12 now ignores it. CI checkouts no longer contain that directory, so the Autobahn run will fail before it even starts. Either restore the reference repo (e.g., submodule/clone) or point the workflow at a TypeScript-based spec harness.","example/src/Chat.tsx:11 – getDefaultServer() now derives the base URL from location.host, so when the UI is served from Bun’s dev server it defaults to ws://localhost:3000/… even though example/reverb.config.ts:5 still binds Revurb to port 8080. The chat demo now always errors on the first connect until the user manually types ws://localhost:8080, which is a regression from the previous working default."],"additional_comments":"Logged this review in specs/logs/codex-2025-11-13-1921.json and updated specs/review.md; pushed as cacee07 after the pre-commit hooks ran biome check and tsc --noEmit. Next steps: restore a license file, update spec-tests.yml so CI no longer references the deleted PHP tree, and keep the chat demo defaulting to the actual Revurb socket host."}
