    ".github/workflows/spec-tests.yml:1 – Removing the workflow entirely means CI no longer runs the Autobahn spec suite, so we have zero coverage on the Pusher protocol and no regression detection. The original task was to repoint it at our TypeScript sources, not delete the check outright. Please restore a workflow that exercises revurb-ts's spec harness so CI still validates compliance.",
    "example/src/Chat.tsx:10 – Hard-coding getDefaultServer() to ws://localhost:8080 regresses the location-aware default, so any HTTPS deployment or proxy now tries to open an insecure ws://localhost socket and fails before the user can interact. Keep the host/scheme detection when window.location exists and only fall back to localhost when rendering outside the browser."

  "additional_comments": "README.md and docs.md still describe features/tests from Laravel Reverb; they need a pass after the CI + chat fixes land."
