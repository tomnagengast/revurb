**Review Update**
- Recorded the latest review in `specs/review.md`, flagging commit `045a398` as `status: not ok` because the chat example no longer works when pointed at a private channel.
- The default channel is now `private-chat`, yet `subscribeToChannel` still sends only the channel name without the required `auth` signature, so every subscription is rejected by `PrivateChannel.subscribe()` and no `client-*` events can fire (example/src/Chat.tsx:10, example/src/Chat.tsx:103, src/protocols/pusher/channels/private-channel.ts:11).
- README’s new “Example Application” section and the accompanying work-session notes therefore describe a flow that can’t succeed until authentication is implemented.

**Next Steps**
- 1. Either add the private-channel auth HTTP flow (compute the HMAC using the Bun server and include it in the `pusher:subscribe` payload) or revert the example back to a public channel so the sample remains usable.
- 2. Once the example can authenticate, re-run the chat sample and update the README/work notes accordingly.
