**Review Update**
- Captured the latest review in `specs/review.md`, marking status `not ok` and logging the three blocking findings that came out of inspecting everything since `8d0fb49`.
- Flagged that `example/src/Chat.tsx:46` never answers the server’s `pusher:ping`, so the `PingInactiveConnections`/`PruneStaleConnections` jobs (see `src/protocols/pusher/event-handler.ts:185`, `src/jobs/ping-inactive-connections.ts:47`, `src/jobs/prune-stale-connections.ts:49`) will prune the browser connection after the first heartbeat—need to send a `pusher:pong`.
- Noted that the chat emits `client-message` events on the public `chat` channel without auth (`example/src/Chat.tsx:121`) even though the ported ClientEvent rules restrict client events to private/presence channels (`src/protocols/pusher/client-event.ts:13`), so the sample will stop working once the rule is enforced.
- Pointed out that switching channels only sends more `pusher:subscribe` frames (`example/src/Chat.tsx:94`) and never unsubscribes or clears `messages`, so you stay joined to every prior room while the UI claims you moved.
- Committed and pushed everything (`4b157c6` on `main`) using the requested `git add -A`; this includes the review update plus the pre‑existing formatting/log changes that were already in the workspace.

Tests: not run (not requested).

Next steps:
1. Handle `pusher:ping`/`pusher:pong`, unsubscribe when changing channels, and reset the chat state so it reflects the active room.
2. Add the private/presence channel authentication (or switch to server-triggered events) before relying on `client-*` messages.
