**Code Review**

- `revurb-ts/src/config/load.ts:186-337` – `loadConfig()` unconditionally calls `loadReverbAppConfig()` (which throws if `REVERB_APP_*` env vars are missing) and the env-built `apps` payload then overwrites any `apps` supplied by `reverb.config.ts`. That means the TypeScript server can’t boot from a config file alone (or host multiple config-driven apps) the way Laravel Reverb can; even `revurb start --config …` dies before your file is read. Please skip the env-only path when a config file is provided and merge/append rather than replacing the configured apps so config-driven deployments work again.

- `revurb-ts/src/Servers/Reverb/factory.ts:1045-1085` together with `revurb-ts/src/Protocols/Pusher/Http/Controllers/connections-controller.ts:70-198` and `revurb-ts/src/Protocols/Pusher/Http/Controllers/channel-users-controller.ts:120-217` – `convertToHttpRequest()` stores `pathname + search` in `request.path`, and those controllers feed `request.getPath()` straight into the signature string without stripping the query string. Pusher signatures are computed over the path *without* the query, so every signed GET to `/apps/{id}/connections` or `/channels/{channel}/users` now fails with “Authentication signature invalid.” even when the signature matches the PHP server. Trim the query string (as the PHP controllers do) before building `signatureString`.

- `revurb-ts/src/application-manager.ts:97-125` defaults `allowed_origins` to `[]` for config-defined apps, but `Server.verifyOrigin()` (revurb-ts/src/Protocols/Pusher/server.ts:256-279) treats an empty list as “reject everything.” The PHP config defaults to `['*']`, so omitting the field still allows browsers to connect. Right now any config-defined app without an explicit `allowed_origins` immediately throws `InvalidOrigin`. Align the default with the PHP implementation so WebSocket handshakes aren’t blocked by default.

`specs/review.md` was updated with these findings, committed, and pushed (`5a29f769aea034affedcfc63e44ef926f8207eb9`). Let me know if you’d like me to prototype fixes or add regression tests for these areas.
