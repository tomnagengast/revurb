# Review - Production-ready Redis work

## Findings

1. `RedisClientFactory` ignores the query parameters that `RedisClient.redisUrl()` uses to carry authentication and database information (`username`, `password`, `db`). Because of that, any configuration that relies on `REDIS_USERNAME`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`, or `REDIS_DB` is silently dropped and the client always connects as an anonymous user to database 0. This regresses parity with Laravel Reverb and makes password-protected Redis deployments impossible.
2. `RedisPubSubProvider.subscribe()` now runs every time the subscriber reconnects (thanks to `RedisSubscribeClient`'s auto-resubscribe), but the method re-registers a `message` listener during each invocation without removing the prior handler. After the first reconnect you will process every broadcast N-times, and more generally leak listeners forever.

Need follow-up fixes before we can truthfully claim production-ready Redis.
