**Review Update**
- `specs/review.md:1` now records commit `885650a` as `status: not ok` and documents the three blockers: duplicate logger modules tracked under both `src/loggers/*` and `src/Loggers/*` keep `tsc --noEmit` failing on Linux (static-analysis run 19346402004), the WebSocket E2E test in `tests/e2e/websocket-simple.test.ts:8` still binds to a hard-coded port 8084 and crashes CI with `EADDRINUSE` (tests run 19346402003), and the docs in `notes/2025-11-13-1234-objectives-verification.md:10` plus `notes/2025-11-13-1328-github-actions-fix.md:20` prematurely mark Objective #2 as “✅” even though `spec-tests` run 19346402008 reports `❌ Test case Reverb failed`.
- Captured the GH Actions evidence via `gh run view` for those runs so the underlying issues are documented, and the automation log snapshots generated during the review (`specs/logs/composer-2025-11-13-{1317,1327}.md`) are checked in.
- Changes are committed and pushed as `66cf535 (review: capture findings for 885650a)`; the pre-commit hook ran `biome check --write .` and `tsc --noEmit` cleanly.

Next steps:
1. Remove the duplicate uppercase `src/Loggers/*` entries (or rename everything consistently) so the static-analysis job can compile on Linux.
2. Update `tests/e2e/websocket-simple.test.ts` to use an ephemeral/free port or guarantee teardown, eliminating the `EADDRINUSE` failure in `tests.yml`.
3. Investigate the Autobahn spec failure from run 19346402008 (inspect the `reports` artifacts) and keep Objective #2 open until the workflows go green.
