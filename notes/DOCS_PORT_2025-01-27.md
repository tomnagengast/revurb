# Documentation Port - January 27, 2025

## Summary

Translated Laravel Reverb documentation (`docs/docs.md`) to revurb-ts (`revurb-ts/docs.md`) and ensured the documentation works as described.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Comprehensive Documentation (`revurb-ts/docs.md`)

- Translated all sections from Laravel Reverb docs to revurb-ts
- Adapted for TypeScript/Bun instead of PHP/Laravel
- Updated installation instructions for Bun
- Converted configuration examples to TypeScript
- Updated CLI commands to match revurb-ts implementation
- Adapted production deployment instructions for Bun runtime
- Noted differences from Laravel Reverb (no restart command, no Pulse/Telescope integration)

### 2. Fixed Health Endpoint Documentation

- Corrected health endpoint from `/health` to `/up` to match actual implementation
- Added example JSON response

### 3. Implemented Automatic Config File Loading

- Updated `src/config/load.ts` to automatically check for `./reverb.config.ts` file
- Matches the behavior described in CLI help text and documentation
- Config loading priority:
  1. Explicit `--config` path
  2. `./reverb.config.ts` (automatic)
  3. Environment variables only

## Documentation Structure

The documentation includes all major sections:

- Introduction
- Installation
- Configuration (Application Credentials, Allowed Origins, Additional Applications, SSL)
- Running the Server (with Debugging and Restarting notes)
- Monitoring
- Production Deployment (Open Files, Event Loop, Web Server, Ports, Process Management, Scaling)

## Verification

- ✅ Health endpoint path corrected (`/up`)
- ✅ Config file loading matches documentation
- ✅ CLI commands match documentation examples
- ✅ Configuration examples use correct TypeScript syntax
- ✅ All environment variables documented

## Notes

- Laravel-specific features (Pulse, Telescope, Artisan commands) are noted as not available
- Restart command is noted as requiring manual stop/start or process manager
- Redis scaling implementation notes the default mock implementation
