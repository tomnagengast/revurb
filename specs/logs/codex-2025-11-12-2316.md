**Review Update**
- Recorded the latest review in `specs/review.md:1-6`, marking status as not ok because the new agent docs overstate the port’s readiness while `tsc` still reports real type errors (controllers using `request.path/body/method`, metrics handler Map casts, missing `override` in the factory). Captured all affected file paths/lines so the fixes are traceable.
- Called out the documentation inaccuracies introduced in this batch: the session summary now claims “Proper TypeScript types (no `any` types)” even though files like `revurb-ts/src/config-application-provider.ts:17-93` still rely on `any`, and the maintenance log asserts docker-compose/Dockerfile work happened in this session despite no matching commits in `c16f44d..HEAD`. These are now documented in the review comments so the history stays honest.
- Committed and pushed as `docs: record review for port status docs` (`2c2cfd8`) after rebasing on the remote updates.

**Tests**
- `cd revurb-ts && bun test` (passes: 89 tests across 11 files, though server logs still show expected InvalidApplication errors during negative cases).
- `cd revurb-ts && ./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit` (fails with the controller/IHttpRequest, metrics handler, and ServerProvider issues noted in the review).

**Next Steps**
1. Fix the TypeScript compile errors (`controller.ts`, `channels-controller.ts`, `metrics-handler.ts`, `factory.ts`) so `tsc --noEmit` succeeds again.
2. Replace the lingering `any` usages (e.g., in `config-application-provider.ts`) or relax the documentation claims about type hygiene.
3. Update the agent session notes to describe actual changes made in `c16f44d..2c2cfd8`, or implement the docker-compose/Dockerfile work they currently reference.
