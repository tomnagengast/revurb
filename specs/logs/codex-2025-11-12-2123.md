- Logged the new review in `specs/review.md`, covering all changes through f7184406e16f31ba0e44df26997d3f513498aa10.
- Blocking issue: `Log` gained no `debug()` proxy even though `ILogger` and every implementation now expose that method, so any ported code calling `Log.debug(...)` (mirroring Laravel’s behavior) will throw; add a `Log.debug` wrapper in `revurb-ts/src/loggers/log.ts:57` before merging.
- Tests: `bun test` (passes).
- Changes committed to `main` as ab84fb6 and pushed to origin.
