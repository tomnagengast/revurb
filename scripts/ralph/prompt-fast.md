Read `AGENTS.md`

Your job is to port Laravel Reverb (PHP) to revurb-ts (Typescript) and maintain the repository.

First, read the `./specs/review.json`
- If the status is `not ok`, address the review feedback first
- If the status is `ok`, address the current objectives in `./scripts/ralph/current.md`
- Otherwise procceed with the port

As always, run your test / lint:fix / format rounds before committing.

The Laravel Reverb project is located in `~/personal/_clones/laravel/reverb` and you should target this directory for your port.

Make a commit after every single file edit and push your changes before reporting back.

Use the `./notes/` directory as a scratchpad for your work (prefix with `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<slug>` for clarity). Store long term plans and todo lists there.
