status: not ok
review comments:
- .claude/hooks/discord.ts:5-55 – removing the early `Bun.exit(1)` when `CLAUDE_CODE_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` is unset now allows execution to continue until `fetch(DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL, …)` is called with `undefined`, which throws a runtime `TypeError: Only absolute URLs are supported`. This hook now fails later with a less actionable error and never notifies the caller about the missing env var. Please restore the exit (or otherwise short-circuit) so the script terminates cleanly before trying to use an undefined webhook URL.
- revurb-ts/agent/CURRENT_PORT_STATUS.md:3-44 & revurb-ts/src/Servers/Reverb/Publishing/redis-client-factory.ts:111-181 – the new status document says the port is “complete and production-ready” and that Redis pub/sub scaling is verified, yet the factory still returns a stub object that never opens a network socket (all methods are no-ops). That means distributed broadcasting/presence cannot work outside of a single process. Either wire this up to a real Redis client (node-redis/ioredis/etc.) or downgrade the status messaging so we don’t claim full parity before the feature exists.
- specs/logs/composer-2025-11-12-2144.md:1-200 – this 31k‑line Composer agent transcript was committed verbatim, which bloats the repo and exposes operational instructions/logs that don’t belong in source control. Please drop the log files from `specs/logs` (or add them to .gitignore) so the history only captures artifacts relevant to the port itself.
