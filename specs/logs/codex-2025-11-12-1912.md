Updated `specs/review.md` with the latest commit hash and review outcome, flagging the regression caused by the new default Content-Type logic. The change highlights that `Response` now injects an `application/json` header even when callers already set `content-type` in a different casing (e.g., `revurb-ts/src/Servers/Reverb/Http/server.ts:197,203,212`), so text/plain responses end up with two conflicting MIME declarations and clients may honor the JSON one.

Next steps:
1. Normalize header keys inside `Response` (or otherwise detect Content-Type case-insensitively) before inserting defaults.
2. Add a unit test that proves a caller can still force `text/plain` (or other types) when needed.

Let me know if you’d like me to prototype the fix once you pick an approach.
