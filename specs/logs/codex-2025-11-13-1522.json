{"commit":"5b329f5c9e5593ba58d4bde7dc1dc659787acd94","status":"ok","review_comments":["No blocking issues found; `docs.md:192` now states the server defaults to `127.0.0.1:8080`, matching the behavior in `src/config/load.ts:157` so we no longer suggest the daemon exposes every interface by default.","`docs.md:211` clarifies that operators can still opt into `0.0.0.0` while keeping `127.0.0.1` as the default, preventing confusion about how to route production traffic."],"additional_comments":"Residual risk: these are documentation-only changes, so there is no automated safety net that verifies README/docs instructions against the CLI behavior. Logged the review in `specs/logs/codex-2025-11-13-1527.json` and updated `specs/review.md` to reference commit c784312; pushed as 5b329f5."}
