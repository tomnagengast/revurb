# Build

Your job is to port Laravel Reverb (PHP) to revurb-ts (Typescript) and maintain the repository.

## Instructions

Prep:
- 0a. familiarize yourself with the code in `src` and `tests`
- 0b. familiarize yourself with `AGENTS.md` and `README.md`

First, read the `./specs/review.md`
- If the status is `not ok`:
    - Address the review feedback
- If the status is `ok`:
    - Read `./scripts/ralph/current.md` (if it references a spec target that instead) and complete the **single** highest priority item using up to 50 subagents
    - Update `./scripts/ralph/current.md` (or the spec if targeted) with your progress
- 4. use `git add -A` and `git commit -m "..."` to commit your changes, then push before reporting back

## Notes

The Laravel Reverb project is located in `./reverb` (gitignored, for reference only) and you should target `./` for your port.

Use the `./notes/` directory as a scratchpad for your work (prefix with `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<slug>` for clarity). Store long term plans and todo lists there.
