status: not ok
review comments:
- `bun run lint` still exits non-zero (141 errors). `EventDispatcher` is still implemented as a static-only class (`src/protocols/pusher/event-dispatcher.ts:127`), `channels-controller` continues to rely on a non-null assertion (`src/protocols/pusher/http/controllers/channels-controller.ts:88`), and the channel/HTTP controller contracts still use `any` for their payloads (`src/protocols/pusher/concerns/interacts-with-channel-information.ts:14`, `src/protocols/pusher/http/controllers/channel-users-controller.ts:92`, etc.), so the new `noStaticOnlyClass`/`noExplicitAny` rules keep failing. Objective 0 ("Fix the lint errors returned by bun run lint") remains unmet.
- Objective 1 is also untouched: there have been no changes under `.github/workflows` in commits `0f4a8ac`–`2e54f30`, and `scripts/ralph/current.md:1-2` still list "Ensure GitHub Actions run successfully" as active work, so we still lack the required CI alignment with `@reverb/.github`.
