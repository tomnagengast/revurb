Updated `specs/review.md` with today’s findings (status still “not ok”) and pushed as commit `e05a48e` so the repo history reflects the latest review.

Key review findings (also recorded in the doc):
- `tests/e2e/websocket-simple.test.ts:3`, `tests/e2e/channel-subscription.test.ts:3`, `tests/e2e/private-channel.test.ts:3`, `tests/e2e/presence-channel.test.ts:3`, `tests/e2e/websocket-connection.test.ts:3`, and `tests/feature/health-check-controller.test.ts:2` still import `../../src/Servers/Reverb/factory`. After the lowercase rename, that path only resolves on case-insensitive filesystems, so `bun test` will crash on Linux/CI until the imports are updated to `../../src/servers/reverb/...`.
- `README.md:32` and the structure block at `README.md:110-122`, plus `docs.md:37` and the supervisor/PM2 examples at `docs.md:384-401`, continue to instruct readers to `cd revurb-ts` and refer to `src/Servers/...`. Those directories no longer exist after the repo move to root + lowercase, so the public docs now lead contributors to dead paths.
- `scripts/ralph/prompt-fast.md:7-9` still lists “Current focus: rename ./src directories to lowercase” even though commits 07fd5f4/1885382 already finished that work. Leaving the prompt stuck on a completed task risks misguiding the next session.

Tests run: `bun run typecheck`.

Next steps:
1. Fix all test imports to match the lowercase directory layout so the suite runs everywhere.
2. Rewrite the README/docs installation and structure sections to describe the current root-based layout instead of `revurb-ts`.
3. Refresh `scripts/ralph/prompt-fast.md` with the actual next priority (e.g., the GitHub workflow work called out just below the outdated focus).
