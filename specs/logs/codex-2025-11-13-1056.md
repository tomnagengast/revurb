**Review Update**
- `specs/review.md:1-5` now records the latest audit (HEAD `59ffe57`) with status `not ok` and the blocking items that must be resolved.

**Findings**
- `bun run lint` still exits non-zero with 141 errors. Examples: `EventDispatcher` remains a static-only class (`src/protocols/pusher/event-dispatcher.ts:127`), `channels-controller` still uses a non-null assertion on `this.application!` (`src/protocols/pusher/http/controllers/channels-controller.ts:88`), and the channel/HTTP controller contracts continue to expose `any` payloads (`src/protocols/pusher/concerns/interacts-with-channel-information.ts:14`, `src/protocols/pusher/http/controllers/channel-users-controller.ts:92`, plus other controller helpers). Objective 0 (“Fix the lint errors returned by bun run lint”) is therefore still open.
- No progress on Objective 1: there have been zero changes under `.github/workflows` in commits `0f4a8ac`–`59ffe57`, and the task remains listed in `scripts/ralph/current.md:1-2`, so the GitHub Actions parity with `@reverb/.github` is still outstanding.

**Verification**
- `bun run lint` (fails; see findings above)
- `bun run typecheck`

`59ffe57 review: lint and ci objectives outstanding` has been pushed to `origin/main`. Suggested next steps: 1) finish the Biome cleanup so `bun run lint` succeeds, 2) port/enable the missing GitHub Actions workflows to match the upstream configuration.
