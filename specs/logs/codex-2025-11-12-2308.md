**Review Update**
- Analyzed the only new commit since the prior review (b15393f), which just documents the resolved docker-compose env var issue; no new application or porting code changes surfaced that would block the TypeScript port, so no review findings to report.
- Overwrote the review record with the required format to capture the latest hash and “ok” status at `specs/review.md:1`, then committed and pushed as `b1367b9`.
