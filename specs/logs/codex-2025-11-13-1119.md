**Review Update**
- Captured the new review status (still `not ok`) with the outstanding lint, typecheck, and CI parity issues in `specs/review.md:1`.
- Logged the supporting command transcript (lint/typecheck runs) in `specs/logs/composer-2025-11-13-1119.md:1` for traceability.
- Key blockers called out: lingering `any` + unreachable code that keep `bun run lint` red (`src/servers/reverb/http/server.ts:129`, `183`, `198`, `262`, `278`, `303`, `319`), the cascade of `unknown` return values that break `bun run typecheck` (`src/protocols/pusher/http/controllers/channels-controller.ts:91`, `connections-controller.ts:53`, `events-controller.ts:146`, `src/protocols/pusher/metrics-handler.ts:488`, `493`), and the stricter HTTP types that now fail compilation (`src/servers/reverb/http/connection.ts:110`, `120`, `src/servers/reverb/http/router.ts:132`, `386`, `428`, `src/connection.ts:100`, `src/servers/reverb/http/server.ts:117`). Objective 1 from `scripts/ralph/current.md:2` (workflow parity) is still untouched.

**Tests**
- `bun run lint` *(fails: 52 errors, 1 warning as noted above).*
- `bun run typecheck` *(fails with the metrics/router/connection errors listed above).*

`git commit -s -m "review: update status for 15f7528"` and `git push` have been completed.

**Next steps**
1. Drive `src/servers/reverb/http/server.ts`, `router.ts`, and `http/connection.ts` to a lint/typecheck-clean state by removing the remaining `any` usage, guarding optional methods, and fixing the unreachable handler stubs.
2. Tighten `MetricsHandler` and its consumers so they return and narrow concrete types, resolving the compile errors in the controllers and listener (`metrics-handler.ts`, `channels-controller.ts`, `connections-controller.ts`, `events-controller.ts`).
3. Resume Objective 1 from `scripts/ralph/current.md:2` by syncing `.github/workflows` with `@reverb/.github`.
