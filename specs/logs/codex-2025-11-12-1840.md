- Updated `specs/review.md:1` to reflect HEAD `fc0fbbfe` with the requested review format, noting that no new `revurb-ts` code landed and that the previously reported blockers (broken response mapper, missing serverProvider methods, ChannelConnection proxy gap, UsersTerminateController returning the wrong Response type) remain unresolved.

Next steps:
1. Teach `Factory.convertToResponse` to read the custom Response getters so controllers can set real status/headers.
2. Replace or guard the stubbed `serverProvider` before calling `subscribesToEvents()` in the terminate controller.
3. Restore ChannelConnection method proxies (or unwrap the raw connection) so `PruneStaleConnections` can run.
4. Have `UsersTerminateController` return the custom Response (`new Response({}, 200, headers)`) so the factory can forward JSON bodies and error codes.
