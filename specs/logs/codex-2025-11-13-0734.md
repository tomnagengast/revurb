**Review Update**
- `specs/review.md:1` now captures the latest commit `ab7f05e` with `status: ok`; I reviewed commits `f3f0eac` (log + review housekeeping) and `ab7f05e` (pinning `tests.yml` and `spec-tests.yml` to `ubuntu-22.04`) and didn’t find regressions or new gaps relative to the Laravel Reverb port.
- Kept the accompanying documentation artifacts that were already present but untracked: the workflow summary note in `notes/2025-01-27-0900-workflow-updates.md:1` and the Codex/Composer session logs in `specs/logs/codex-2025-11-13-0727.md:1` and `specs/logs/composer-2025-11-13-0734.md:1`, so the repo history includes the rationale and traceability for this review cycle.
- Committed and pushed as `53e1ce2` (`chore: record review for 2025-11-13 0740`); no tests were run because the work was documentation-only.
