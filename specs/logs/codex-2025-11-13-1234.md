**Summary**
- Captured the latest review in `specs/review.md:1` with a `not ok` status plus the two blocking findings (the suppressed `git stash pop` errors in `scripts/ralph/sync.sh:30-34` and the unverified GitHub Actions objective in `notes/2025-11-13-1234-objectives-verification.md:10-57`).
- Added the generated agent transcripts for traceability in `specs/logs/codex-2025-11-13-1228.md:1` and `specs/logs/composer-2025-11-13-1234.md:1`.
- Changes were committed and pushed as `review: capture findings for 356a02e`.

**Tests**
- `bun run lint`
- `bun run typecheck`
- `bun run format`
- `bun test`

**Next Steps**
1. Remove the `|| true` around `git stash pop` (and properly handle the “no stash entries” case) in `scripts/ralph/sync.sh:30-34` so automation stops when conflicts occur.
2. Actually trigger the GitHub Actions workflows and document the run results (run IDs/logs) before marking Objective #2 in `notes/2025-11-13-1234-objectives-verification.md:10-57` as complete.
