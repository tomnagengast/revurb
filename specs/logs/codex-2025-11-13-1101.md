**Code Review**
- Documented the latest findings in `specs/review.md` (commit `5890f4d`) covering work through `42bd78b`.
- `bun run typecheck` now fails: `IHttpRequest` was introduced on `channel-users-controller`, but the code still calls `request.url`, `request.text()` and reuses that path in `verifySignature`, so `tsc --noEmit` stops at `src/protocols/pusher/http/controllers/channel-users-controller.ts:100,109,194-195`. `channels-controller` also attempts to spread an `unknown` (`src/protocols/pusher/http/controllers/channels-controller.ts:107`), so the build remains red.
- Objective 0 (“Fix the lint errors and warnings…”) remains unsatisfied; `bun run lint` still emits 117 errors, including the non-null assertions in `src/protocols/pusher/http/controllers/events-controller.ts:121-123` and `src/protocols/pusher/managers/array-channel-manager.ts:221`, the `Record<string, any>` parameter at `src/protocols/pusher/http/controllers/channels-controller.ts:268`, and the lingering `any` usage in both `src/protocols/pusher/http/controllers/connections-controller.ts:36-75` and `src/protocols/pusher/pubsub-incoming-message-handler.ts:14`.
- Objective 1 (“Ensure GitHub Actions run successfully”) is still untouched: `scripts/ralph/current.md:1-2` continues to list it, and there were no `.github/workflows` changes in `2e54f30..42bd78b`, so CI parity with `@reverb/.github` hasn’t begun.

**Tests**
- `bun run lint` → fails with 117 diagnostics (non-null assertions and `any` usage noted above).
- `bun run typecheck` → fails (`channel-users-controller.ts` missing members on `IHttpRequest`; `channels-controller.ts` spreading `unknown`).

Next steps I’d suggest:
1. Update `channel-users-controller` to rely on the properties/methods actually exposed by `IHttpRequest` (use `request.path`/`getPath()` and drop `text()` or extend the interface), and cast `info` before spreading inside `channels-controller`.
2. Continue removing the remaining `any` and non-null assertions flagged by Biome so Objective 0 can finally be closed.
3. Start porting the `.github/workflows` from `@reverb/.github` to satisfy Objective 1.
