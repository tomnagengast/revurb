review comments:
- `revurb-ts/src/loggers/log.ts:34` / `revurb-ts/src/Servers/Reverb/factory.ts:215` – The new `Log` facade always falls back to `NullLogger` unless `Log.setLogger()` is called, but nothing in the bootstrap path ever does so (searching the repo shows zero call sites). Laravel’s PHP facade resolves the bound `Logger` automatically, so any ported TypeScript code that uses `Log.info(...)` will quietly drop logs. Please make the facade resolve the factory’s logger (e.g., call `Log.setLogger(this.logger)` inside `Factory.initialize()` or have `Log.getLogger()` delegate to the factory) before merging.
- `src/Loggers/log.ts:1` – A duplicate TypeScript copy of the facade was also committed inside the original PHP source tree. That directory is Composer-loaded PHP, so this `.ts` file can’t even compile (it imports `../contracts/logger`, which is a PHP interface) and it diverges from the actual `Log.php`. Remove the stray file or move it under `revurb-ts/src/loggers` only so the ported code lives exclusively in the TypeScript workspace.
