review comments:
- `revurb-ts/src/Protocols/Pusher/Http/Controllers/connections-controller.ts:77` and `channel-users-controller.ts:96` still rebuild their query string from `request.url || request.getPath()`, but `Factory.convertToHttpRequest()` now strips the query string from `getPath()` to fix signature hashing (while the fabricated `httpRequest` instance never exposes a `url`). When these endpoints are hit via the Bun server, the controllers no longer see `auth_key`/`auth_signature` in `url.searchParams`, so every call to `/apps/{id}/connections` and `/apps/{id}/channels/{channel}/users` now throws “Authentication signature invalid.” even with a valid signed request. We need to feed them a path that still includes the search part (e.g., read `request.path` or have `convertToHttpRequest` include `url`) while keeping signature verification on the query-less path.
