**Review Update**
- Updated `specs/review.md` to record the latest review for `12dc3cb6548027af8b0311c21103106abbe92c89`, flagging the port as `not ok`. The comments call out the new webhook hook regression (`.claude/hooks/discord.ts:5-55`), the production-ready claims that contradict the still-stubbed Redis client (`revurb-ts/agent/CURRENT_PORT_STATUS.md:3-44` vs. `revurb-ts/src/Servers/Reverb/Publishing/redis-client-factory.ts:111-181`), and the accidental inclusion of a 31k‑line Composer agent log (`specs/logs/composer-2025-11-12-2144.md:1-200`). Committed and pushed as `4b4bace`.

**Tests**
- `revurb-ts`: `bun test`

**Next Steps**
1. Restore the early exit (or equivalent guard) in `.claude/hooks/discord.ts` so the hook stops immediately when `CLAUDE_CODE_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` is missing instead of failing later inside `fetch`.
2. Either wire `RedisClientFactory` up to a real Redis client or downgrade the “complete/production-ready” messaging in `revurb-ts/agent/CURRENT_PORT_STATUS.md` until multi-instance broadcasting is actually functional.
3. Remove the committed agent log files (e.g., `specs/logs/composer-2025-11-12-2144.md`) and ignore future logs so repository history stays focused on the TypeScript port.
