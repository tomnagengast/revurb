**Review Update**
- `specs/review.md:1` now records the latest code commit (`2bd1314940e02fb801156124208c2aa1bb96d41a`) with `status: not ok` plus a review comment describing why the docker-compose addition blocks acceptance.
- `revurb-ts/docker-compose.yml:1` currently contains only the YAML document marker (`---`). Because no services are defined, `docker compose up` immediately errors, so the file must be populated with at least the Bun app service (and any dependencies such as Redis) or removed until it is ready.
- Committed the review note as `68d8d2a` and pushed to `origin/main`.

Next step: 1) Flesh out `revurb-ts/docker-compose.yml` with real service definitions so it actually launches the ported server stack.
