**Review Update**
- Overwrote `specs/review.md` with the new review (last commit `cdf3c98`), keeping the status at “not ok” because `./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit` still fails: the HTTP controllers keep reading `request.path`, `request.body`, and `request.method` even though `IHttpRequest` doesn’t expose them (`revurb-ts/src/Protocols/Pusher/Http/Controllers/controller.ts:80-172`, `revurb-ts/src/Protocols/Pusher/Http/Controllers/channels-controller.ts:112-213`), `ConnectionData` is still cast to `Map<string, unknown>` (`revurb-ts/src/Protocols/Pusher/metrics-handler.ts:262` and `:583`), and the anonymous `ServerProvider` subclass still lacks the `override` keyword (`revurb-ts/src/Servers/Reverb/factory.ts:245-248`). I also noted that `scripts/ralph/prompt-fast.md:4-8` is now stale because `redis-pubsub-provider.ts:45-59` already defaults to `RedisClientFactory`.
- Recorded the failing `./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit` run so the review is backed by the current build status.
- Changes committed as `ad3007d` (“docs: record port review”) and pushed to `origin/main`.

**Next Steps**
1. Extend `IHttpRequest` (or stop reading unsupported fields) so the controller code at `revurb-ts/src/Protocols/Pusher/Http/Controllers/controller.ts:80-172` and `channels-controller.ts:112-213` type-checks.
2. Replace the unsafe `ConnectionData` → `Map` casts in `revurb-ts/src/Protocols/Pusher/metrics-handler.ts:262,583` with properly typed data structures.
3. Add the missing `override` to the inline subclass in `revurb-ts/src/Servers/Reverb/factory.ts:245-248` (or remove the subclass) so `tsc` passes.
4. Refresh `scripts/ralph/prompt-fast.md:4-8` so the “current focus” reflects work that is still outstanding rather than the already-merged `RedisClientFactory` default.
