**Review Update**
- Looked over commits `3f740e1..aff0f08`; they only add workflow review notes/logs and adjust `AGENTS.md`, so no runtime code changed, but the GH workflows triggered by those commits are failing (confirmed with `gh run list --limit 5`) because `bun test` can’t resolve the Reverb factory module on Linux.
- `specs/review.md:1` now records `last commit: aff0f08` with `status: not ok` and cites the case-sensitive import bug that blocks CI; see `tests/feature/health-check-controller.test.ts:2` and `tests/e2e/private-channel.test.ts:4`, which still import `../../src/Servers/Reverb/factory`.
- Committed the previously generated trace logs (`specs/logs/codex-2025-11-13-0739.md:1`, `specs/logs/composer-2025-11-13-0744.md:1`) so the audit trail for the earlier workflow verification work is preserved.

Tests: Not run locally (documentation-only edits); GH Actions (tests/spec tests/static analysis/biome) are currently failing because the uppercase `src/Servers/...` imports can’t be resolved on CI’s case-sensitive filesystem.

Next steps:
1. Normalize the remaining `src/Servers/Reverb/*` import paths (or rename the directories) so Bun resolves them on Linux, then re-run the workflows.
2. Use `gh run list --limit 5` (or `gh run watch <run-id>`) to confirm the pipelines turn green after the import fix.
