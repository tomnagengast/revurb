    "No blocking issues: the only changes since cd8a527 touch .github/workflows/spec-tests.yml:1 (workflow display name), scripts/ralph/{backlog.md,current.md,prompt-fast.md,prompt-smart.md}:1-20 (prompt/backlog guidance), and the tracked Codex logs; none of these alter runtime behavior or tooling logic.",
    "Residual risk: removing the historical Codex JSON artifacts from specs/logs/* means new clones must consult git history or specs/logs/archive/ (ignored) for past reviews, so make sure that’s acceptable for future audits."

  "additional_comments": "Documented this review in specs/review.md:1-6 and notes/2025-11-13-2055-review-instructions.md:1-12 and pushed. Tests/hooks run: `biome check --write .`, `tsc --noEmit`. Next up is defining a new priority/spec now that the Redis work is marked complete."
