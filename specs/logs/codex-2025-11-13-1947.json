{"commit":"f8656be4b35d8a62db43d1fef314e2391a0a35f2","status":"not ok","review_comments":[".github/workflows/spec-tests.yml:34 / tests/spec/client-spec.json:3 / tests/spec/spec-analyze.ts:6 – The Autobahn container is still writing its results to `/mnt/autobahn/reports`, yet the workflow (and the new README instructions) only mount the repo at `/config` and `/reports`. Nothing ever populates `tests/spec/reports/index.json`, so the “Analyze test results” step terminates immediately with “No test results found.” Mount the project at `/mnt/autobahn` (and `/mnt/autobahn/reports`) or update both the config outdir and analyzer input path so the reports land where the analyzer expects them.","README.md:134-146 – The new Autobahn blurb copies the same `docker run crossbario/autobahn-testsuite …` command, but that image ships only linux/amd64 layers. Running the documented command on this Apple Silicon box fails with `image … does not provide the specified platform (linux/arm64)`, so contributors on M-series Macs can’t execute the spec suite. Document the required `--platform linux/amd64` flag (or publish an arm64-compatible image)."],"additional_comments":"Recorded the findings in specs/logs/codex-2025-11-13-2019.json and updated specs/review.md; pushed as \"review: capture findings for 3253f78\". Tests: `biome check --write .`, `tsc --noEmit`. Next up: fix the Docker volume/outdir mismatch, add the platform flag to the docs/CI command, then rerun the spec workflow."}
