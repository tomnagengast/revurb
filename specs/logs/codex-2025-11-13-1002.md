Documented the latest review cycle in `specs/review.md:1`, marking commit `921c925` as the new baseline with `status: ok` because the only changes since 2d24b48 were housekeeping updates (review note + status update) and raised no technical issues. Added the two pending session log artifacts (`specs/logs/codex-2025-11-13-0956.md:1`, `specs/logs/composer-2025-11-13-1002.md:1`) per the “commit all” instruction so the repository reflects the complete context of the prior work.

Tests: not run (docs-only review update).

Next steps: 1) Continue porting work once new commits land and repeat this review process for subsequent changes.
