**Code Review**
- Logged the required summary in `specs/review.md:1` with status `not ok` and three blocking findings for the post-a004239 work.
- `.github/workflows/spec-tests.yml:55-66` points the Autobahn step at `tests/Specification`, which does not exist in this repo (the fixtures live under `reverb/tests/Specification`). As written the job fails with `ENOENT` before Docker starts, so the spec workflow never runs.
- `.github/workflows/spec-tests.yml:37` starts the Bun server on port 9001 while `reverb/tests/Specification/client-spec.json:7` still tells Autobahn to connect to port 8080, guaranteeing every case fails to connect even after fixing the directory issue.
- `tests/e2e/websocket-simple.test.ts:4` (and the other e2e/feature tests) now import `../../src/servers/reverb/factory`, but the module is still tracked as `src/Servers/Reverb/factory.ts:1`. On any case-sensitive filesystem (Linux CI, Docker) Bun can’t resolve the lowercase path, so `bun test` aborts before the suites run unless the directory rename is actually committed.

**Git**
- Commit `18f658c` (“chore: record review for 2025-11-13”) has been rebased onto the latest `origin/main` and pushed as requested.

Next steps: 1) point the spec workflow at `reverb/tests/Specification` (or adjust paths) and make the Autobahn port match the server; 2) either finish committing the lowercase directory rename or revert the tests to the current `src/Servers/...` casing so Linux builds work.
