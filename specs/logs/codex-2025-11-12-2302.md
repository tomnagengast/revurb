**Code Review**
- `revurb-ts/docker-compose.yml:18-37` defines the Bun app container without `REVERB_APP_KEY`, `REVERB_APP_SECRET`, or `REVERB_APP_ID`, but `loadReverbAppConfig` throws immediately when any of those env vars are missing (`revurb-ts/src/config/load.ts:186-195`), so `docker compose up` will still abort before the server starts. Provide placeholder credentials (they can be dummy values for local use) or mount a config file so the app has at least one application defined.

**Updates**
- Captured the review in `specs/review.md` with status `not ok` and the issue above.
- Committed as `docs: record review for docker compose envs` and pushed to `main`.

Next step: add the required REVERB_APP_* variables (or config file) to the compose setup so the new Redis/Bun services can boot successfully.
